* Unix workflows
A monthly meetup in Dublin for sharing Unix tools and workflows.

E.g. share how you use tools like [[https://tmux.github.io][tmux]], [[https://mosh.org][mosh]], [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html][AWK]] to to make your day-to-day easier and automate your work

The format is:
- 1 hour of short talks & live demos
- chat in the pub after

*N.B.* Make sure to bring your laptop!

You will be able to post links to tools and configs etc on the meetup page or this repo after [[https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/][(PR]]s are welcome!).

This file was written using [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/][Org mode]], a sort of plain text todo list and organiser for emacs.

* Unix philosophy
This meetup group is about learning tools that adhere to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy][Unix philosophy]].

This can be summarised as:
- *Write programs to do one thing and do it well.*
- *Write programs to work together.* 
- *Write programs to handle text streams because that is a universal interface.*

There's a lot of great material around about Unix history and philosophy, here are some links we found preparing the first session:
